# NotReddit

[NotReddit](https://not-reddit-frontend.netlify.app) is a simple web application that is the result of one of the tasks set out during the Northcoders [full-stack JavaScript bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/remote-coding-bootcamp). This web application allows you to view and comment on articles that are saved in a PostgreSQL database. Requests are made to [an API](https://github.com/CrypticSignal/NotReddit-backend) that I created, which queries the database and returns the requested data.

## Getting Started:

NotReddit has been deployed to the web using Netlify. Click [here](https://not-reddit-frontend.netlify.app/) to take a look!

Alternatively, you may run this web application locally. Please find instructions on how to do so below. This application was developed using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/installed) v17.3, and therefore it is recommended that you have v17.3 (or newer) of Node.

- `git clone https://github.com/CrypticSignal/NotReddit-backend.git`
- `cd NotReddit-backend`
- `npm install`
- `npm start` - this will run the web application on http://localhost:3000
